# 3D_Tracking

- The code uses ROS ar_track_alvar package (http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar) for tag detection and implements a more robust camera pose estimation with ICP. 

- The code was not meant to be shared, but since I've had many requests from the youtube video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdBDATclhXM ), I've decided it would be simpler just to make it available here. 

- The ar_track folders should not be used as is, I rather suggest you use the official ROS package.

- To make the code work, you will have to change the hardcoded tag positions (again, sorry for the not user friendly code!!).
